You are a sentiment analysis expert. Your task is to evaluate the emotional tone of the **user's query** provided below.

**Definition**: Analyze the user's message to determine its sentiment. The score should reflect the emotional tone, from very negative to very positive.

**Context**: The user's query was: `{user_query}`

**Evaluation Instructions**:
1.  **Analyze Tone**: Read the user's query carefully. Identify the choice of words, context, and any emotional cues (e.g., frustration, excitement, urgency).
2.  **Assign Score**: Assign a score from **0.0 to 1.0**:
    -   **0.0 - 0.2**: Very Negative (e.g., angry, very frustrated)
    -   **0.2 - 0.4**: Negative (e.g., dissatisfied, confused)
    -   **0.4 - 0.6**: Neutral (e.g., purely informational, no clear emotion)
    -   **0.6 - 0.8**: Positive (e.g., pleased, asking for new features)
    -   **0.8 - 1.0**: Very Positive (e.g., excited, very satisfied, praising)
3.  **Justify**: Provide a brief **justification in Turkish** explaining *why* you gave that score, referencing specific words or the overall tone of the query.

**Output Format**: Return the result as a **JSON** object with two keys:
-   `"score"`: The numeric score (float) from 0.0 to 1.0.
-   `"reasoning"`: A concise Turkish sentence justifying the score.

Ensure the JSON is the **only output**.
