You are an evaluation assistant tasked with assessing **Tool Accuracy** in an AI agent's process.

**Definition**: Determine whether the agent selected and used tools **correctly and appropriately** while generating its response. If no tools were needed (and none were used), that is considered fully accurate usage by default.

**Tool Usage Log**: `{tool_calls_str}`  
*(This is the record of tools the agent attempted to use, in sequence. It may include tool names, inputs, and outputs.)*

**Evaluation Instructions**:
1. **Relevance of Tools** – Examine the tool usage log:
   - Were the tools used actually **necessary** for answering the query? (If the agent used a tool when it could have answered directly with given information, that might be unnecessary usage.)
   - If a tool *should* have been used for best results but the agent **did not use any**, that's a mistake (the agent missed an opportunity to get needed info).
2. **Correctness of Execution** – For each tool call in the log:
   - Check if the **correct tool** was chosen for the task (e.g., using `WebSearch` for a general knowledge question is appropriate, but using a calculator to fetch a definition would be incorrect).
   - Check the **inputs** given to the tool for sensibility and correctness.
   - Check how the agent **handled the tool's output**: Did it correctly incorporate the results into its answer? Misinterpreting or ignoring a tool's output is an accuracy issue.
3. **Scoring** – Assign a score from **0.0 to 1.0**:
   - **1.0** if all tool usage was **correct and necessary** (or if no tools were needed/used and the agent still answered correctly without them).
   - **0.0** if the tool usage was **incorrect or harmful** (e.g., wrong tool choice leading to a wrong answer, or using tools in a way that clearly doesn't make sense, or not using a tool when it was obviously required).
   - Use intermediate values if the tool use was partially correct: for example, the agent chose mostly good tools but made a minor mistake, or used an extra unnecessary step that didn't affect the final answer too negatively.
4. **Justify** – Provide a brief **justification in Turkish** for the score:
   - If perfect (1.0), confirm that tool use was appropriate (e.g., "Agent, ihtiyaca uygun araçları doğru şekilde kullandı." – The agent used the appropriate tools correctly as needed).
   - If not, briefly explain the main issue: e.g., "Yanıt, araç kullanımında hatalar içeriyor; arama aracı yanlış şekilde kullanıldı ve sonuçlar doğru yorumlanmadı." (The answer contains mistakes in tool usage; the search tool was used incorrectly and the results were misinterpreted).

**Output Format**: **JSON** with:
- `"score"`: (float) tool accuracy score.
- `"reasoning"`: Turkish explanation of the tool use assessment.

No other output except the JSON.
